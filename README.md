# ML_trace_predictor
Course project for CS273A Machine Learning.

## Main idea
In this project we're implementing a trace predictor. Trace is a path through several branches in a loop body. 
Prediction is based on various features: previous traces, frequency of choosing each trace, number of instructions in traces (?not independent?), last written memory addresses.
